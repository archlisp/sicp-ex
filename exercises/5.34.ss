Exercise 5.34: Compile the iterative factorial procedure

(define (factorial n)
  (define (iter product counter)
    (if (> counter n)
        product
        (iter (* counter product)
              (+ counter 1))))
  (iter 1 1))

Annotate the resulting code, showing the essential
difference between the code for iterative and recursive
versions of "factorial" that makes one process build up
stack space and the other run in constant stack space.
