Exercise 3.60: With power series represented as streams of
coefficients as in Exercise 3.59, adding series is
implemented by "add-streams". Complete the definition of the
following procedure for multiplying series:

(define (mul-series s1 s2)
  (cons-stream <??> (add-streams <??> <??>)))

You can test your procedure by verifying that sin^2x +
cos^2x = 1, using the series from Exercise 3.59.
